        <p class="narration">
            The UBEPSSA online library is a free to use digital platform that gives all physiotherapy students access to academic resources that will make their learning pursuits easier.
        </p>
        <p class="narration">
            The Library aims to remove all inconveniences that come with looking for materials (PDFs and presentations), mock exam questions, assignment questions and solutions and even past questions from previous exams. 
        </p>
        <p class="narration">
            The library also aims to help with the confusion that sets in when our final year students are searching for a topic for their projects. Hence, the library compiles all possible resources (included are the ones done by our predecessors and eye-catching projects done by other great minds outside UNIBEN) to ensure the progress and success of our final year students.
